## Riding red box
Welcome to Space Dodge, a fun and engaging arcade-style Python game built using the Pygame library. In this game, you control a spaceship trying to avoid falling stars from the sky. The main objective is to survive as long as possible while dodging the stars and keeping track of your elapsed time.

The game features a simple control mechanism, allowing you to move your spaceship left and right using the arrow keys. As time progresses, the difficulty increases with more stars falling at a faster rate, putting your reflexes to the test. The game ends when a star collides with your spaceship, at which point players are shown a "You Lost!" message for a brief moment before exiting.
